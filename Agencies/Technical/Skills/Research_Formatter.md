# Research Formatter: UNF DHA Guidelines

This skill provides a comprehensive set of rules and formatting guidelines for Doctor of Health Administration (DHA) dissertations and research papers at the University of North Florida (UNF). The following standards must be applied with doctoral-level rigor.

## 1. General Page Formatting
The document must adhere to specific margin requirements to ensure compatibility with binding and archival standards. A left margin of 1.5 inches is mandatory. The top, bottom, and right margins must be set to 1.0 inch. The entire document should utilize a 12-point Times New Roman font. Double-spacing is required throughout the manuscript, including within block quotes and the reference list, unless specific table or figure guidelines dictate otherwise. Text must be aligned flush left, leaving the right edge ragged; justification is prohibited. The first line of every paragraph must be indented 0.5 inches using the tab key rather than spaces.

## 2. Citation Style: APA 7th Edition
The DHA program mandates strict adherence to the American Psychological Association (APA) 7th Edition style. In-text citations for a single author should follow the parenthetical format of Author and Year, such as (Smith, 2023). Citations involving two authors must list both surnames separated by an ampersand, as in (Smith & Jones, 2023). For works with three or more authors, the citation must list the first author's surname followed by "et al." in every instance, as demonstrated by (Smith et al., 2023). Direct quotations require the inclusion of the page number immediately following the year, for example, (Smith, 2023, p. 15).

The reference list must begin on a new page at the conclusion of the document, identified by the bold and centered heading "References". Each entry in this list requires a hanging indent, where the first line is flush left and subsequent lines are indented 0.5 inches. Entries must be arranged alphabetically by the surname of the first author.

## 3. Structural Elements
A standard DHA dissertation follows a specific sequence of components, though students should verify these details with their committee chair. The manuscript begins with a Title Page formatted according to the strict UNF Graduate School template. This is followed by optional pages for Copyright, Dedication, and Acknowledgments. An Abstract is required to summarize the problem, methods, study results, and conclusions. The front matter concludes with a Table of Contents, followed by a List of Tables and a List of Figures where applicable.

The body of the dissertation typically consists of five chapters. Chapter 1 introduces the background, problem statement, purpose, research questions, and significance of the study. Chapter 2 presents the Literature Review, including the theoretical framework. Chapter 3 details the Methodology, covering design, population, data collection, and analysis. Chapter 4 presents the Results. Chapter 5 offers a Discussion, interpreting findings, implications, limitations, and recommendations. The document concludes with the References and any necessary Appendices.

## 4. Writing Style, Tone, and Integrity
Academic writing at the doctoral level requires a formal, objective, and scholarly tone. Authors must avoid colloquialisms, jargon, and overly emotional language. The active voice is preferred for clarity and directness, such as stating "The researchers analyzed the data" rather than using the passive construction "The data was analyzed by the researchers." The text should employ the third-person point of view, avoiding first-person pronouns like "I" or "we" unless explicitly permitted for reflective sections. Anthropomorphism must be avoided; research studies do not "find" or "suggest" outcomes, rather, the results of the study indicate specific conclusions.

Zero plagiarism is a non-negotiable standard. All work must be original and properly cited. The content must be written authentically by the student and must not rely on generative AI for composition, ensuring the work is not detectable as AI-generated. The use of em dashes is strictly prohibited in favor of alternative punctuation that maintains formal continuity.

## 5. UNF Specific Requirements
The Graduate School requires the final submission to be in PDF format. The language of the document must be English, adhering to standard American spelling and grammar conventions. Ethical considerations are paramount; therefore, proper IRB approval must be documented for any research involving human subjects. Students are advised to consult the latest guidance from the UNF Graduate School Thesis & Dissertation Canvas site to ensure compliance with all current requirements.
