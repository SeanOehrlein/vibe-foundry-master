- **Objective**: Execute Stand-Up and Formalize Multi-System Sync Protocol.
- **The Wins**: 
    - Successfully synchronized Desktop and Laptop via high-fidelity Stand-Up/Down workflows.
    - Established thematic identities: **Foundry-Prime** and **Foundry-Mobile**.
    - Locked in C:\1. SanEnso Vibe Coding as the mandatory root path.
- **The Friction**: Identified directory naming discrepancies on the laptop which initially caused pathing confusion.
- **Architectural Insights**: Opted for "Thematic AI Instances" to better orient the agent during handoffs and prevent context fragmentation.
- **Alternatives Considered**: We considered simple functional names (Desktop/Laptop), but thematic names (Prime/Mobile) strengthen the persona and sense of "central brain" vs "mobile unit".
- **Inspiration/References**: Refinement of the Vibe Coding Protocol standard.
- **Tags**: #sync, #architecture, #persona, #infrastructure
- **The Vibe**: High-efficiency discovery. Transforming technical friction (syncing) into a formal project asset (the protocol).
- **Next Step**: **Phase 3: Memory & State** (Implementing Episodic Memory).
