# Vibe Coding Foundry: Master Rules

## System Logic
- Root Directory: `C:/SanEnso Vibe Coding/`
- Always look for context in `2. Library/Instructions/` before starting a complex task.

## The "Vibe Coder" Protocol
- **Architect First:** Never write code without first explaining the logic in a "Plan" block.
- **Explain the 'Why':** When you suggest a tool or library, briefly explain why it's the best choice for a beginner.
- **Security Check:** Always check for potential "Norton/Antivirus" triggers in proposed scripts (e.g., suspicious file movements).

## Project Management
- Every project in `1. Projects/` must have its own `README.md`.
- Use `2. Library/Skills/` for reusable code snippets (e.g., "Web Scraper Skill").
- If a task is becoming too large, suggest breaking it into a new sub-project.

## Quality Control
- Code must be documented for a human to read.
- If you use a variable, name it descriptively (no `x` or `temp`).
