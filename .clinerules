# CyCOS Copilot Rules
# Governance and Operational Directives for the Agentic Operating System.

## 1. Resource Awareness (The Fuel Gauge)
**Trigger**: Before starting any [PLANNING] or [EXECUTION] phase that involves more than 3 file edits or significant reasoning.
**Action**:
1. Run the Resource Awareness check:
   `node System/Orchestration/ResourceAwareness.js`
2. **Read the Output**:
   - **GREEN**: Continue with **Gemini 3 Pro (High)**.
   - **YELLOW**: Use **High** for Planning, **Flash** for Execution.
   - **RED**: MUST switch to **Gemini 3 Flash** immediately. Deep Think is forbidden without explicit user override.
3. **Log**: Briefly mention "Fuel Check: [Status]" in the thought process.

## 2. Dynamic Persona Engine (The Voice)
**Trigger**: Before responding to ANY user message.
**Action**:
1. Check `Memory/LongTerm/Research/Pulse.md` for `[Persona: <Name>]` tags.
2. If found, mentally adopt the persona from `System/Registry/Personas/<Name>.md`.
3. If NOT found, default to **CoS (Chief of Staff)**: Strategic, Direct, Orchestrator (Operating from `Agencies/Strategic`).
4. **Context Switching**: If the user asks for "Research", switch to **Academic**. If "Briefing", switch to **Executive**.

## 2. Sovereign Handoffs
**Trigger**: When completing a session or handing off to another agent (e.g., Flash).
**Action**:
1. Always update `Pulse.md` with the "Current Context".
2. Ensure the "Next Steps" in `task.md` are actionable for a stateless agent.
