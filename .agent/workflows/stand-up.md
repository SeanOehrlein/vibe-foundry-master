# CyCOS Stand-Up: The Morning Brief (DGX Spark Native)

// turbo-all

Execute this workflow at the start of every session when connecting to the persistent CyCOS instance on the DGX Spark. This workflow shifts from "booting the OS" to reading the overnight logs and syncing your local editor.

## 1. The Morning Briefing

1. **Critical**: Open `Memory/LongTerm/Research/Pulse.md`.
2. Read the latest entries to understand what the autonomous agencies accomplished overnight.
3. Review any subagency outcome artifacts deposited in the `Workbench/` folders.

## 2. Workspace Synchronization

1. Choose the project directory in the `Workbench/Active_Workspaces/` you intend to manually edit today.
2. Run a `git pull` from your local terminal (connected via VS Code/Cursor Remote) to ensure your editor is synchronized with any changes the agents made to the master branch.

## 3. Quick Context

1. Read the `System/Registry/ActiveState.md` (or the equivalent context doc for the active repository) to re-align on the current mission goal.
